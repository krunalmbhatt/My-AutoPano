### RBE 549: Classical and Deep Learning Approaches for Geometric Computer Vision [[Problem Statement ](https://rbe549.github.io/spring2023/proj/p1/)]

## What is this about?

#### Phase 1: Classical Approach

The purpose of this project is to stitch two or more images in order to  create one seamless panorama image. Each image has few repeated  local features (âˆ¼ 30-50% or more, emperically chosen).

#### Phase 2: Deep Learning Approach

For Phase 2, we implemented two neural networks. One was supervised learning network [[Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03798.pdf)]  and another is unsupervised learning network [[Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03798.pdf)].

## Acknowledgment 

This project is done as a requirement in the course RBE 549 taught by Dr. [Nitin J. Sanket](https://nitinjsanket.github.io/) at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute.  This is a fun and challenging way to learn some basic concepts! 

Please read the report! Thank you!
